## Technology / Sponsors
- **[Unlock Protocol](https://unlock-protocol.com/) (General Track)**
    - We rely on Unlock Protocol to represent mortgages as subscriptions. They are a recurring payment to the break, which when ended, will revoke the NFT that represents the property. We use [Unlock's JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/unlock-protocol/unlock) to query locks, or available mortgages to sign. We use their existing dashboard for the bank perspective to offer functionality of creating mortgages for new properties, but we built our own dashboard in this repository to view available ones for potential buyers.

- **[Propy](https://propy.com/home/) (RWA Track)**
    - While Propy doesn't have a developer platform to build off of yet, we would intend to build off of their legal framework that connects properties to NFTs. These NFTs are the ones that would be put up as collateral in a mortgage, since they could be revoked if payments aren't made to the loan.
